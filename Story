  Once upon a time, there was a young boy who lived in the kingdom of Pepsi.  He was from a poor family, but he was happy, as Pepsi was a rich nation which cared for its people; however, upon his eightteenth birthday, the kingdom of Sprite attacked.  The invasion was swift and brutal, usurping the monarchy within the day.  Many lives were lost, and nearly every field was salted.  The boy, living in a more rural area, was at least safe form the initial attack, but nobody could excape the rammifications of the political upheaval.
