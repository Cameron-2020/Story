  Once upon a time, there was a young boy who lived in the kingdom of Pepsi.  He was from a poor family, but he was happy, as Pepsi was a rich nation which cared for its people; however, upon his eightteenth birthday, the kingdom of Sprite attacked.  The invasion was swift and brutal, usurping the monarchy within the day.  Many lives were lost, and nearly every field was salted.  The boy, living in a more rural area, was at least safe form the initial attack, but nobody could excape the rammifications of the political upheaval.
  
Sprite won the war, of course. Soon after the defeat, the pepsi handouts that the family was relying on started to taste bitter. Sprite was sabotaging pepsi by slowly
putting little bits of poison in their soda. One by one, citizens of the kingdom of Pepsi started to fall ill. The young boy decided he had had enough and started putting
together a malitia to fight back.
